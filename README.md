## Architecture rationale

API-
ASP.NET Core MVC controllers + Razor views.
Orchestrates requests, model binding, and validation surfacing.
ExceptionHandlingMiddleware for friendly errors, and Serilog request logging.

Application-
Use cases implemented as *Service classes behind I*Service interfaces.
Accept/return DTOs, not EF entities.
FluentValidation enforces business/field rules (server-side).
AutoMapper maps DTOs â‡„ domain entities.
Common helpers: PagedResult<T> for paging/sorting/search.

Domain-
Persistence-agnostic entities (Employee, Department) and simple invariants.
Optional base entity for audit columns (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted).
No framework dependencies.

Infrastructure-
EF Core AppDbContext and repositories (*Repository) behind interfaces.
Soft delete (boolean field): IsDeleted column + query filters or explicit Where(e => !e.IsDeleted).
Migrations, connection strings, and data access optimizations.
Registered via DI; can be swapped without touching upper layers.
